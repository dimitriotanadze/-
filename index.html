            >For many years, we've seen lots of blog posts and conversation on
            the topic of "browser engine diversity". I'd like to offer a
            slightly tilted view of this based instead on "the health of the
            ecosystem", and explain why I think this is more valuable measure
            and way to discuss these topics.</i

          Back in January, Jeremy Keith
          <a href=" https://adactio.com/journal/16331">
            compared the complexity of browser engine diversity to political
            systems...</a
          >
        </p>
        <p class="list_item">
          "If you have hundreds of different political parties, that’s not
          ideal. But if you only have one political party, that’s very bad
          indeed!"
        </p>
        <p>
          I like this analogy because I think he's right in even more ways than
          he intended. It's almost self-evident: 1 is too few, a hundred is too
          many - it's just chaos and noise. But what is the ideal number? This
          answer dogs us a lot, in part because it is not only unanswerable,
          it's actually kind of a red herring. I think there's something to this
          that leads to an important takeaway about how we think about the
          problem...
        </p>
        <h2 class="center">Numbers and goals...</h2>
        <p>
          The interesting part about this analogy is that the simple number of
          political parties isn't actually a very meaningful measure: Parties
          can differ a lot, or they can differ a little. 6 parties that barely
          disagree is quite a different thing than 3 that disagree
          substantially. Further, it's not simply a matter of giving voice to
          every dissenting opinion that matters either: There are political
          parties formed on ideas of hate, for example. Adding those doesn't add
          good things. In short, what really matters is the goal of those
          numbers.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the case of the political analogy, the real aim is about what makes
          for a healthy, effective and just model of governance. Similarly on
          the topic of "browser engine diversity", I believe that the real goal
          is "What makes for a healthy and effective ecosystem?" and that the
          numbers we frequently talk about (and how) can easily lead us into
          perhaps the wrong takeaways.
        </p>
        <h2 class="center">Older engines and diversity</h2>
        <p>
          It is fairly common that discussions of browser diversity point to the
          Web's own history for examples of "why engine diversity matters": IE
          vs Netscape are often held up. IE's dominance and ability to dictate
          the market (or even kill it in this case) was overcome by diversity.
          This is true, but very incomplete: There's a lot more beneath the
          surface...
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider, for example, the fact that for a time there were only two
          mainstream browsers - and the very dominant one (IE) was both entirely
          proprietary and based on a single proprietary OS
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider how different this could have been, if IE had been open
          source and properly licensed. Even if Microsoft didn't want it to run
          on other operating systems, someone else could step in and fill that
          gap. If Microsoft walked away from the Web, or worse, went belly up,
          someone could fork and take over the project. If, for any reason at
          all, the primary maintainer cannot prioritize - other people and
          organization could more directly invest in advancements.
        </p>
        <p>
          A while later, Opera's Presto was very interesting, even multi-OS -
          but ultimately similarly proprietary.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, while we had greater 'diversity', these numbers alone aren't a
          great measure of the overall health of the ecosystem.
        </p>
        <h2 class="center">The most healthy, open ecosystem ever.</h2>
        <p>
          This is in stark contrast to the situation today: In important ways,
          we are a more diverse, efficient and healthier ecosystem with the
          three multi-os, open source engines we have left (Blink, Gecko and
          WebKit) than when we had had more and were dominated by projects that
          weren't that at all
        </p>
        <div class="note"></div>
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> A lot of people seem to want to suggest that
          there aren't really 3 today because blink was born from a fork of
          WebKit, or because they think that WebKit is somehow "Just for iOS".
        </p>
        <p>
          There are certainly 3 entirely different JavaScript engines, and 3
          entirely different architectures. There are some bits that remain
          similar, but the truth is that that this is neither new nor easily
          solvable. Web engines today are so astonishingly complex (measured in
          tens of millions of lines of code) that we only get new ones through
          evolution. For the most part, this has been true for a long time. Even
          Netscape was a "take 2" from many of the same minds from Mosaic.
          Mozilla was created from a rework of Netscape. Even IE was born by
          licensing the Mosaic code. WebKit was born by forking KHTML. In other
          words: The critical investment required to create a full-blown
          compliant browser from nothing would be mind-boggling if everything
          were stopped today - and it never stops.
        </p>
        <p>Today, the 3 that remain are all multi-OS.</p>
        <p class="list_item">"...Wait, even WebKit?" - you, just now.</p>
        <p>
          Yes! I'm glad you asked! The GNOME flagship Epiphany/Web browser for
          Linux is WebKit based -- and billions of devices are based on Embedded
          WebKit. PS4 is a fun example of something lots of people might be
          familliar with -- not only the Web browser on your PS4, but in fact
          lots of the UI itself is made with Web content running in a WebKit
          based browser. But chances are pretty good that you encounter emdedded
          WebKit all the time: On cable boxes, smart TVs and appliances, kiosks,
          car and airplane infotainment systems, digital signage and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is possible because WebKit (and all of the engines today) are
          open source. Because of this, they all receive investments more widely
          than the org that maintains them, and that's expanding in important
          ways that are very good for the health of the ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          galia, where I work, for example are able to work on all of the
          browsers and help expand investment in advancing the commons. The list
          of things we have helped advance, and who has helped fund that is
          growing all the time: From recent things in JavaScript like class
          fields and Big Integer, to CSS features like CSS Grid, or features in
          HTML like lazy loading - the benefits of this are clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also leads to lots of interesting new opportunities. For example,
          we are the creators/maintainers of WPE, the official WebKit Port for
          Embedded that powers tons of those devices mentioned above. This
          matters a lot because a rising tide lifts all boats in the commons.
          You can see an example of this in that Igalia is advancing work on
          SVG2 and hardware acceleration for SVG in WebKit - a topic which has
          failed to get the prioritization for years, but is especially critical
          for lots of embedded use cases. If you're interested in this, as well
          as
          <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/Igalia-Chats-Niko-SVG-WPE"
            >some interesting history of SVG, WebKit, HTML/CSS and embedded
            browsers, have a listen to this.</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>Opportunities to do better...</p>
        <p>
          here is another interesting thing here that is always left out of
          these discussions but I think is considerably interesting in this
          reframing. A funny little quirk of history is that while we say there
          are 3 rendering engines, that's only partially true.
        </p>
        <p>
          More specifically, there are 3
          <i
            >modern browser rendering engines, and a bunch of other rendering
            engines that aren't that.</i
          >i>
        </p>
        <h2 class="center">More open prioritization</h2>
        <p>
          But it's not just the projects being open source that matters, it's
          also that this affords us new opportunities for standardization
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, it is the calculus of prioritization which impacts our
          ability to get things done almost more than anything else.
          Historically, lots of companies get together and, effectively, ask
          that a very few companies do the work. They are big organizations with
          big investments, to be sure - but they are all constrained by hard
          limits. The gauntlet of issues surrounding our ability to prioritize
          everything from attention to actual implementation have stymied many a
          topic.
